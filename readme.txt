Clarification
there is one thing which requirement doesn't specified
if 2 or more candidates have the same amount of matched skills
then who is the most qualified candidate?

Due to the time limitation (4 hours), there are some areas need to improve
1. write independent test project and write test case first
2. make it configurable, such as web api URL, how many items to show in each page, the best idea is put those into configuration file, rather than hard code.
